# claycli
A CLI For Clay!

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/clay/claycli.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/clay/claycli) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/clay/claycli/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/clay/claycli?branch=master)

# Installation

```
npm install -g claycli
```

# Usage

```
clay <command> [options]
```

If installed globally, call `clay` from the command line. Much like `git`, `claycli` is configured using a [dotfile](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) (`.clayconfig`) in your home folder. In it you may specify references to api keys and urls / site prefixes that you use frequently. For urls and site prefixes, it will assume `http://` and port `80` unless you specify otherwise.

Note that a _site prefix_ is everything before the api route, e.g. `http://domain.com/site1` in `http://domain.com/site1/_components/article`.

```
[keys]
  local = ha8yds9a8shdf98asdf
  qa = 8quwqwer09ewr0w9uer
  prod = bj34b6345k634jnk63n4
[urls]
  local-site1 = https://localhost.site1.com:3001
  local-site2 = site2.com/site-2 # http and port 80
```

For smaller Clay installations (or, ironically, for very large teams where devs spend most of their time on individual sites), you may specify a default api key and url / site prefix by using the `CLAYCLI_DEFAULT_KEY` and `CLAYCLI_DEFAULT_URL` environment variables.

# Commands

* [`config`](https://github.com/clay/claycli#config)
* [`lint`](https://github.com/clay/claycli#lint)
* [`import`](https://github.com/clay/claycli#import)
* [`export`](https://github.com/clay/claycli#export)

## Common Arguments

`claycli` uses some common arguments across many commands.

* `-v, --version` will print the `claycli` version and exit
* `-h, --help` will print helpful info about `claycli` and exit
* `-r, --reporter` allows specifying how results should be logged
* `-c, --concurrency` allows setting the concurrency of api calls (defaults to 10)
* `-k, --key` allows specifying an api key or alias

### Logging

When running `claycli` programmatically (i.e., `import { someMethod } from 'claycli'`), most commands will return a stream of objects with `{ type, message, details }`. The `type` may be `success` (signalling that an operation succeeded), `error`, `warning`, `info`, or `debug`. As you can see, most of those correspond directly to log levels.

When running `claycli` from the command line, you may specify a `reporter` argument to output logs in different formats. The default is `dots`, which will print out green and red dots showing operation success / failure. There is also `pretty` (which prints more detailed messages on each line), `json` (which prints newline-separated json logs in a format that can be passed to ELK), and `nyan` (which is mostly just for fun).

```bash
clay lint --reporter pretty domain.com/_components/article
```

You may also specify which reporter to use by setting the `CLAYCLI_REPORTER` environment variable. If you add a `reporter` argument, it will be used instead of the env variable.

```bash
export CLAYCLI_REPORTER=json
```

`claycli` pipes to `stderr`. If you want to pipe the logs to a file, you may use `2>`.

```bash
`clay lint --reporter json domain.com/_components/article 2> article-log.json`
```

## Handling Files

### Dispatch

Many `claycli` commands allow you to pipe in the contents of files to `stdin` or pipe data out from `stdout`. The format that `claycli` uses to represent data (similar to a database dump) is called a _dispatch_, and it consists of newline-separated JSON without site prefixes.

```
{"/_components/article/instances/123":{"title":"My Article","content":[{"_ref":"/_components/paragraph/instances/234","text":"Four score and seven years ago..."}]}}
{"/_components/meta-title/instances/345":{"title":"My Article","ogTitle":"My Longer Titled Article","twitterTitle":"Article"}}
```

Each line of a _dispatch_ contains [composed data for a component](https://github.com/clay/amphora/blob/master/lib/routes/readme.md#component-data) (or page, user, list, etc), including any data for its child components. This means that each line is able to be sent as a [cascading PUT](https://github.com/clay/amphora/pull/73) to the Clay server, which is a highly efficient way of importing large amounts of data. Note that a _dispatch_ is not meant to be human-readable, and manually editing it is a very easy way to introduce data errors.

A _dispatch_ may be piped into or out of commands such as `clay import` and `clay export`. Because _dispatches_ are a special format (rather than regular JSON files), the convention is to use the `.clay` extension, but this isn't required.

```bash
clay export domain.com > article_dump.clay
clay import domain.com < article_dump.clay
clay export domain.com | clay import localhost
```

### Bootstrap

For working with human-readable data, we use a format called a _bootstrap_. These are human-readable [yaml](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/YAMLSyntax.html) files that divide components (and pages, users, lists, etc) by type. [This is the same format that is used by the `bootstrap.yml` files in your Clay install](http://clay.github.io/amphora/docs/lifecycle/startup/bootstrap.html).

```yaml
_components:
  article:
    instances:
      123:
        title: My Article
        content:
          - _ref: /_components/paragraph/instances/234
  paragraph:
    instances:
      234:
        text: Four score and seven years ago...
  meta-title:
    instances:
      345:
        title: My Article
        ogTitle: My Longer Titled Article
        twitterTitle: Article
```

A _bootstrap_ may be piped into and out of any `claycli` commands that accept _dispatches_. To tell `claycli` that you're dealing with _bootstraps_, please use the `--yaml` argument.

```bash
clay export --yaml domain.com > article_dump.yml
clay import --yaml domain.com < article_dump.yml
```

If you're a backend developer or database architect, it may be helpful to think of _dispatches_ and _bootstraps_ as [denormalized and normalized data](https://medium.com/@katedoesdev/normalized-vs-denormalized-databases-210e1d67927d). You'll notice that the two examples above contain the same data. The denormalized _dispatches_ allow a single API call per line and use less memory because they're streamable, while the normalized _bootstraps_ are better for hand-coding data because components are not duplicated if referenced multiple times. Generally speaking, use _dispatches_ for transporting and storing data and _bootstraps_ for hand-coding.

## Config

```bash
clay config --key <alias> [value]
clay config --url <alias> [value]
```

Show or set configuration options. These are saved to `~/.clayconfig`. As specified above, sites will assume `http` and port `80` if you do not write the protocol and port.

### Arguments

* `-k, --key` allows viewing or saving an api key
* `-u, --url` allows viewing or saving a url / site prefix
* `-r, --reporter` allows specifying how results should be logged (note: all reporters except `json` report `clay config` the same)

### Examples

```bash
clay config # view all configuration options
clay config --key local # view 'local' api key
clay config --key local ab27s9d # set 'local' api key
clay config --url qa # view 'qa' site prefix
clay config --url qa https://qa.domain.com:3001 # set 'qa' site prefix
clay config --url my-cool-article domain.com/_components/article/instances/123 # set a specific url
```

## Lint

```bash
clay lint [--concurrency <number>] [url]
```

Verify Clay data against standardized conventions and make sure all child components exist.

Linting a page, component, or user url will verify that the data for that url exists, and (for pages and components) will (recursively) verify that all references to child components exist. The url must be a raw url, an alias specified via `clay config`, or omitted in favor of `CLAYCLI_DEFAULT_URL`. Linting a public url (or a page/component url that has a `.html` extension) will attempt to render that url with the extension and, if that fails, try to figure out which component isn't rendering correctly. You may lint other renderers by providing their extensions, e.g. `.amp` or `.rss`.

Instead of linting a url, you may pipe in a component's `schema.yml` to lint. It will go through the schema and verify that it conforms to [Kiln's schema rules](https://claycms.gitbooks.io/kiln/editing-components.html).

### Arguments

* `-r, --reporter` allows specifying how results should be logged
* `-c, --concurrency` allows setting the concurrency of api calls

### Examples

```bash
clay lint domain.com/_pages/123 # lint all components on a page
clay lint domain.com/2018/02/some-slug.html # lint a page via public url
clay lint domain.com/_components/article/instances/abc.html # lint a component and its html
clay lint my-cool-article # lint a component specified via config alias
clay lint < components/article/schema.yml # lint single schema
```

## Import

```bash
clay import [--key <api key>] [--concurrency <number>] [--publish] [--yaml] [site prefix]
```

Imports data into Clay from `stdin`. Data may be in _dispatch_ or _bootstrap_ format. Site prefix must be a raw url, an alias specified via `clay config`, or omitted in favor of `CLAYCLI_DEFAULT_URL`. Key must be an alias specified via `clay config`, or omitted in favor of `CLAYCLI_DEFAULT_KEY`.

The `publish` argument will trigger a publish of the pages and / or components you're importing. Note that the generated url of an imported page might be different than its original url, depending on your Clay url generation / publishing logic.

### Arguments

* `-k, --key` allows specifying an api key or alias
* `-r, --reporter` allows specifying how results should be logged
* `-c, --concurrency` allows setting the concurrency of api calls
* `-p, --publish` triggers publishing of imported pages
* `-y, --yaml` specifies that input is _bootstrap_ format

### Examples

```bash
clay import --key local localhost:3001 < db_dump.clay # import a dispatch
clay import --key qa --publish --yaml < bootstrap.yml # import and publish pages in a bootstrap
wordpress-export domain.com/blog | clay import --key local localhost.domain.com # pipe from 3rd party exporter
clay export --key prod domain.com/_components/article/instances/123 | clay import --key local localhost.domain.com # pipe from clay exporter
cat *.clay | clay import --key local localhost:3001 # import multiple dispatches
tail -n +1 *.yml | clay import --key local --yaml localhost:3001 # import multiple bootstraps
find . -name '*.yml' -exec cat "{}" \; | clay import --key local --yaml localhost:3001 # recursively import multiple bootstraps
cat **/*.yml | clay import --key local --yaml localhost:3001 # recursively import multiple bootstraps (bash v4+ & zsh)
```

## Export

```bash
clay export [--key <api key>] [--concurrency <number>] [--size <number>] [--layout] [--yaml] [url]
```

Exports data from Clay to `stdout`. Data may be in _dispatch_ or _bootstrap_ format. The url must be a raw url, an alias specified via `clay config`, or omitted in favor of `CLAYCLI_DEFAULT_URL`.

If the url points to a site prefix (i.e. it does not point to a specific type of data (a specific page, public url, component, user, list, etc)), `claycli` will query the built-in `pages` index to pull the latest 10 pages from the site. When querying the `pages` index, you must specify a `key` or have the `CLAYCLI_DEFAULT_KEY` set. The api key is only required when exporting multiple pages (by querying the `pages` index or by running custom queries, below).

Instead of fetching the latest pages, you may pipe in a yaml-formatted [elasticsearch query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_introducing_the_query_language.html). Use this to set custom offsets (for batching and chunking exports), export non-page content from other indices, or filter exported data via certain properties. Note that if you pipe in a query that includes `size`, it will take precedence over the CLI `size` argument.

```yaml
index: pages
size: 100
body:
  sort:
    updateTime:
        order: desc # sort by latest updated
  query:
    bool:
      must:
        -
          prefix:
            uri: domain.com/site-path # show only pages for a specific site
        -
          match:
            published: true # show only published pages

```

You may also query other elastic indices, but please make sure that each document returned has a clay uri (e.g. `domain.com/_components/foo/instances/bar` or `domain.com/_pages/foo`) as its `_id`.

```yaml
index: published-products
size: 5
from: 10
sort:
  - price
body:
  query:
    match_all: {}
```

By default, layouts are not exported when exporting pages. This allows you to easily copy individual pages between sites and environments. To trigger layout exporting, please use the `layout` argument.

### Arguments

* `-k, --key` allows specifying an api key or alias
* `-r, --reporter` allows specifying how results should be logged
* `-c, --concurrency` allows setting the concurrency of api calls
* `-s, --size` specifies the number of pages to export (defaults to 10)
* `-l, --layout` triggers exporting of layouts
* `-y, --yaml` specifies that output is _bootstrap_ format

### Examples

```bash
clay export domain.com/_components/article/instances/123 > article_dump.clay # export individual component
clay export --yaml domain.com/_pages/123 > page_bootstrap.yml # export individual page
clay export --layout --yaml domain.com/_pages/123 > page_bootstrap.yml # export page with layout
clay export domain.com/_pages/123 | clay import --key local local.domain.com # copy page to local environment
clay export --key prod --size 1 domain.com > recent_page.clay # export latest updated page
cat query.yml | clay export --key prod domain.com > db_dump.clay # export custom query to dispatch
clay export --yaml --key prod domain.com/sub-site < query.yml > pages.yml # export custom query to bootstrap

# note that 'cat query.yml | clay export' and 'clay export < query.yml' are equivalent ways
# to pipe from a file into claycli in most operating systems

# other things you may export

clay export domain.com/_users/abs8a7s8d --yaml > my_user.yml # export single user
clay export domain.com/_users --yaml > users.yml # export all users
clay export domain.com/_lists/tags > tags.clay # export single list
clay export domain.com/_lists > lists.clay # export all lists
clay export domain.com/2017/02/some-slug.html # export published page via public url
clay export domnain.com/_lists/new-pages # export built-in 'New Page Templates' list (page uris will be unprefixed)
```

# Programmatic API

The core `claycli` functionality is exposed as an api, allowing you to use it in Node.js.

**Config**

* `config.get(type, alias)` - get `key` or `url` from config
* `config.getAll()` - get full config object
* `config.set(type, alias, value)` - set `key` or `url` in config

**Lint**

* `lint.lintUrl(url, { concurrency })` - lint a url
* `lint.lintSchema(yaml)` - lint a schema (passed in as a string of yaml)

**Import**

* `import(string, url, { key, concurrency, publish, yaml })` - import a string of dispatches or bootstraps to the specified (site prefix) url
* `import.parseBootstrap(string, url)` - parse a string of bootstrap data into a stream of prefixed dispatches. note: does NOT do http calls
* `import.parseDispatch(string, url)` - parse a string of dispatches into a stream of prefixed dispatches. note: does NOT do http calls

**Export**

* `export.fromURL(url, { concurrency, layout, yaml })` - export a single url, e.g. `domain.com/_components/foo` or `domain.com/_pages`
* `export.fromQuery(url, query, { key, concurrency, layout, yaml, size })` - export the results of a query (passed in as a string of yaml)
* `export.clearLayouts()` - clear the layouts cache. when exporting pages with layouts, they'll be cached so they don't need to be exported for every page
